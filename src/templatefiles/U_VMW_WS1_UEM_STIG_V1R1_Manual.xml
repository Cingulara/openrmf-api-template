Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their application session prior to vacating the vicinity, applications need to be able to identify when a user's application session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. This is typically at the operating system level and results in a system lock, but may be at the application level where the application interface window is secured instead.

Otherwise, there is no assurance that a malicious actor has not inserted itself in the process of packaging the code or policy. For example, messages signed with an invalid certificate may contain links to malware, which could lead to the installation or distribution of that malware on DoD information systems, leading to compromise of DoD sensitive information and other attacks. Therefore, the Workspace ONE UEM server must have the capability to configure the enterprise certificate.

8. Under "User" tab, verify User Group connection information. If not set according to organizational rules, modify the User Group connection to the correct setting.
9. Under "Group" tab, verify Group connection information. If not set according to organizational rules, modify the Group connection to the correct setting.
10. If any changes made to Server, User, or Group settings, click "Save".
11. Choose "X" to close screen.
12. Choose "Groups and Settings".
13. Choose "All Settings".
14. Under "Devices and Users", choose "General".
15. Choose "Enrollment".
16. On the "Authentication Modes" setting, verify only the box titled "Directory" is selected. If "Directory" is unchecked, select it. If any other boxes are checked, uncheck them.
17. If any changes were made to "Authentication Modes" settings, click "Save".
18. Choose "X" to close the window.

To verify and remove any administrator accounts that are not Directory Service accounts:
19. Choose "Accounts &gt;&gt; Administrators &gt;&gt; List View.
20. Review user types under the "Admin Type" heading, and select all users, and only users, with an Admin Type of "Basic". Do NOT select users with an Admin Type of "Directory". Selecting one or more users with the Basic Admin Type will cause the "More Actions" drop-down to appear.
21. From the More Actions drop down, select "Delete". This will result in an "Are you sure you want to delete this record?" pop-up box asking to confirm deletion of the selected account(s).
22. Click "OK" to delete the selected accounts.

To verify and remove any user accounts that are not Directory Service accounts:
23. Choose Accounts &gt;&gt; Users &gt;&gt; List View.

If only a small number of user accounts are listed, it is recommended to use the following steps:
a. Under the "General Info" tab, click each username link to view the user's summary data.
b. Under "Type" in the "User Info" column, if "Basic" is listed, the user account must be removed. Choose the "More" drop-down and select "Delete". A pop-up window will appear stating whether the user was successfully deleted. Click "OK" to close the window.
c. Choose "List View" again to be presented with the list of user accounts and repeat steps a and b until the full set of user accounts has been examined.

If a large number of user accounts are listed, it is recommended to use the following steps instead:
a. Choose the "Export" drop-down and select the format to be used for the export list.
b. An "Export List" pop-up window will appear with instructions on where the exported list of user accounts is located.
c. Examine the exported list. If any user accounts are denoted as "Basic" in the "Security Type" column, the account must be deleted.
d. To delete a user account, click the username link of the user account under "List View". Choose the "More" drop-down and select "Delete". A pop-up window will appear stating whether the user was successfully deleted. Click "OK" to close the window.
e. Choose "List View" again to be presented with the list of remaining user accounts and repeat step d until all user accounts with a Security Type of "Basic" have been deleted.</fixtext><fix id="F-107871r2_fix" /><check system="C-101073r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_VMware Workspace ONE UEM STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review the MDM platform to verify user and administrator authentication is implemented via an enterprise directory service.

On the Workspace ONE UEM console complete the following procedure to ensure that the Workspace ONE UEM (MDM) Server is configured to leverage an enterprise authentication mechanism, and that Workspace ONE UEM users and administrators can only use directory accounts to enroll into the Workspace ONE UEM (MDM) Server:

1. For Workspace ONE UEM server Platform configuration, refer to "https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-UEM/1907/Directory_Service_Integration/GUID-AWT-DIRECTORYSERVICESOVERVIEW.html".
2. Log in to the Workspace ONE UEM Administration console.
3. Choose "Groups and Settings".
4. Choose "All Settings".
5. Under "System" heading, choose "Enterprise Integration".
6. Choose "Directory Services".
7. Under "Server" tab, verify directory service connection information.
8. Under "User" tab, verify User Group connection information.
9. Under "Group" tab, verify Group connection information.
10. Choose "X" to close screen.
11. Choose "Groups and Settings".
